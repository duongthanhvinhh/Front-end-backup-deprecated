    <h1>In this exercise, you will learn about js change src, i.e How to turn on/off the Light</h1>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('myId').src='https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulbon.gif'">Turn on</button>
    <img id="myId" src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulboff.gif" alt="">
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('myId').src='https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_bulboff.gif'">Turn off</button>

    <pre>
        Note that: In this exercise, you don't need to create a style with id = myId. Because you don't use it for style the tag, use only use id for getElementById
        When you run this program, turn on and turn off will be in the same line, because button is an inline level not a block level like p tag
